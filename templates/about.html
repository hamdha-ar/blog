      <p>Hello and welcome! I'm an <strong>Associate Software Engineer</strong> at <strong>Gramener</strong>, a Straive company. I graduated from <strong>NIT Calicut</strong> with a degree in <strong>Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)</strong>, but my real passion has always been coding and software development.</p>

      <p>Born and raised in <strong>Kerala</strong>, I was always fascinated by technology—whether it was breaking apart gadgets, debugging code, or experimenting with new programming languages. My journey into development started during my college years, where I explored <strong>AI, machine learning, and full-stack development</strong>.</p>

      <p>Now, I specialize in building <strong>scalable applications, AI-driven solutions, and web technologies</strong>. This blog is my creative space where I share insights, tech experiences, and coding challenges. If you love talking about <strong>AI, software engineering, or emerging tech</strong>, let’s connect and grow together!</p>
